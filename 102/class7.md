1. *What is control flow?*
Control flow in JavaScript refers to the order in which the code executes in a program. It dictates how the program responds to conditions and makes decisions based on those conditions. 
- conditional statements
- loops
- function calls
- exception handling 

2. What is a JavaScript function? 
A JavaScript function is a piece of code that you can use to perform a specific task. Functions help you organize your code and make it easier to manage and reuse.

3. What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?
To invoke or call a function means to execute the code defined within that function. When you invoke a function, you run the code it contains, and it may perform an action or return a value.

- Arguments are the values you pass to a function when you call or invoke it. They are used to provide specific data that the function can operate on.

4. What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?
*Defining Parameters*
When you define a function, parentheses are used to specify parameters. These parameters are placeholders for the values (arguments) that will be passed to the function when it is called. If a function doesn't require any parameters, you still include empty parentheses.
*Calling a Function*
When you invoke (or call) a function, you use parentheses to execute the function. If the function requires arguments, you include them inside the parentheses.
*Empty Parentheses*
If a function does not take any parameters, you still include parentheses to indicate that it's a function.

**Vocab**
- *script*: In JavaScript, a script refers to a block of JavaScript code that can be executed by a web browser or a JavaScript runtime environment (like Node.js). JavaScript scripts are used to create dynamic and interactive content on websites.

- *Programmatic problem solving*: the process of breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable parts and using programming techniques and logic to devise a solution. This approach is fundamental in computer science and software development, as it allows programmers to create efficient, effective, and scalable solutions to various challenges.

- *Expression*: piece of code that evaluates to a value. Expressions can be as simple as a single value or variable, or they can be more complex combinations of values, variables, operators, and function calls. The key characteristic of an expression is that it produces a value when executed.

- *Operators*: In JavaScript, operators are special symbols that perform operations on one, two, or three operands and return a value. Operators are fundamental to manipulating data and controlling the flow of a program.

- *Function*: reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions help you organize your code, making it modular, easier to maintain, and reusable throughout your program.

- *Refactoring*: in JavaScript (or any programming language) is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. The goal of refactoring is to improve the code's readability, maintainability, and performance, making it easier to understand, extend, and debug in the future.
