**What are variables in JavaScript?** *Variables are used to store data values that can be referenced and manipulated throughout your code. A variable acts as a container for storing data, which could be anything like a number, string, boolean, object, or more complex data structures like arrays and functions.*

**What does it mean to declare a variable?**  *Declaring a variable in JavaScript means creating a variable and giving it a name, which allows you to store and later manipulate data in your program. Declaring a variable doesn't necessarily assign it a value right away; it simply sets aside space in memory for that variable.*

**What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?** *The assignment operator (=) in JavaScript is used to assign a value to a variable. It takes the value on the right-hand side (the value or expression) and stores it in the variable on the left-hand side. The assignment operator is essential for initializing variables and updating their values throughout your program.*

**What is information received from the user called?** *The information received from the user is generally referred to as input. In the context of programming, input refers to any data or information that a user provides to a program, often through an interface like a form, a prompt, or an event (e.g., clicking a button).*

**Vocab**
1. Variables
Variables store data values. You can declare them using var, let, or const.

2.  Data Types
JavaScript supports several data types like:

Numbers: let x = 42;
Strings: let name = "Alice";
Booleans: let isTrue = true;
Arrays: let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
Objects: let person = {firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe"};

3.  Operators
JavaScript supports different types of operators:

Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %
Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=
Comparison Operators: ==, ===, !=, >, <
Logical Operators: &&, ||, !

4.  Conditionals (if/else)
Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on conditions.

`let age = 18;`

`if (age >= 18)` {
  console.log("You are an adult");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor");
}

5. Loops
Loops are used to repeat a block of code until a condition is met.

*for loop*: Iterates a specific number of times.
*while loop*: Repeats code while a condition is true.

6. Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

7. Objects
Objects are key-value pairs and can store multiple properties.

8. Arrays
Arrays store multiple values in a single variable, and you can perform various operations on them.

9. String Manipulation
Common methods to work with strings:

length: Returns the length of a string.
toUpperCase(): Converts a string to uppercase.
toLowerCase(): Converts a string to lowercase.
slice(): Extracts part of a string.

10. DOM Manipulation
JavaScript can interact with the HTML Document Object Model (DOM) to modify web pages.

11. Comments
You can add comments to your code to make it easier to understand.

- Single-line comment: // This is a comment

- Multi-line comment:

/*
  This is a multi-line comment
*/
