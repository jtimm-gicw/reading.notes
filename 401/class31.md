## Choosing the State Structure

When you build components in React (or any app that holds state), state is like your notebook where you’re tracking information.  
If your notebook is messy — with repeated notes, crossed-out stuff, and contradictions — you’re going to confuse yourself.  
If your notebook is organized, you’ll save time and avoid mistakes.  

These principles are basically tips for **“keeping your notebook tidy.”**

### 1. Group related state
👉 **Idea:** If two pieces of state always change together, they belong in the same box.  

**Everyday analogy:** Think of your keys and wallet. You always grab them together when leaving home. It makes sense to keep them in the same spot by the door.  

---

### 2. Avoid contradictions in state
👉 **Idea:** Don’t track things that can disagree with each other.  

**Everyday analogy:** If your calendar says “meeting at 2 PM” but your sticky note says “meeting at 3 PM,” you’re going to show up at the wrong time.

### 3. Avoid redundant state
👉 **Idea:** If you can calculate something, don’t store it.  

**Everyday analogy:** You don’t need to write your age in your wallet if you already have your birthday on your ID. Just calculate it.  

---

### 4. Avoid duplication in state
👉 **Idea:** Don’t store the same thing in multiple places.  

**Everyday analogy:** Imagine keeping two separate grocery lists for “things for dinner” and “things for snacks.” If “milk” is on both lists, you might buy two cartons by mistake. Better to have one list and label items.  

---

### 5. Avoid deeply nested state
👉 **Idea:** Don’t bury your data five levels deep inside objects.  

**Everyday analogy:** If you shove your favorite shirt into the bottom of a box, inside another box, in the back of your closet, you’ll never wear it. Keep important stuff easy to reach.

## Why these principles matter
- They save you from bugs (contradictions, forgetting to update duplicates).  
- They make your code simpler to read for future you (and teammates).  
- They keep your app fast and reliable because you’re not tracking extra stuff.  

✅ **Bottom line:** Think of your app’s state like organizing your desk or your notes.  
Messy state = messy code. Clean state = fewer headaches.  

**Everyday Analogy:**  
- Messy state = carrying four different grocery lists for milk, bread, eggs, and “all groceries.” Easy to forget to update one of them.  
- Clean state = carry one master list and check it when you need totals.  

**🖼️ Visual in your head:**  
- Messy desk: papers everywhere, duplicates of the same notes, sticky notes contradicting each other. You spend more time sorting than working.  
- Clean desk: one notebook, everything in order, nothing repeated. You always know where to look.

## Passing State Deeply with Context

### What problem do Contexts aim to solve?
In React, you normally share data by passing props. But when data is needed by components deep in the tree, you’d have to pass it through every “middle” component.  
This is called **prop drilling**, and it quickly becomes repetitive, messy, and error-prone.  

**Contexts** provide a way for a parent component to “broadcast” data to any child below it — no matter how deep — without threading that data through every level in between.  

**Everyday analogy:**  
- Props = handing a note directly from one person to another.  
- Prop drilling = handing the same note through a long line of people who don’t need it.  
- Context = pinning the note on the bulletin board so the right person can read it when they need it.  

👉 **Core idea:** Context solves the problem of deeply passing data through components that don’t actually need it.

### What is one technique to try before useContext?
👉 **Pass props normally first.**  

Props are the simplest, most explicit way to share data in React. Even if you’re passing props down several levels, it often keeps your code easier to understand.  

⚠️ **Why try this first?**
- Props make data flow explicit (you see who needs what).  
- Easier for other developers (or “future you”) to read and debug.  
- Context adds complexity — so only reach for it when prop drilling gets unmanageable.  

💡 **Rule of thumb:**  
- Use props if only a few levels are involved.  
- Use context if the same piece of data is needed by many components far apart in the tree.

### What hook complements useContext for complex applications?
👉 **useReducer**  

**Why?**  
- `useContext` is great for sharing data with many components.  
- But in a big app, you don’t just read data — you also need to update and manage it in consistent ways.  
- That’s where `useReducer` comes in: it gives you a single place to describe how state changes in response to actions.  

**Together:**  
- `useReducer` manages the state logic.  
- `useContext` makes that state (and its update function) available to any component that needs it.  

**Everyday Analogy:**  
- `useContext` = the intercom system (shares info to everyone in the house).  
- `useReducer` = the rulebook (decides what happens when someone presses a button).  

Together, they let you share not just data, but also how that data should change, across your whole app.
