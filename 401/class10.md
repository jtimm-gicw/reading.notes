## Event Driven Programming
1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
✅ **events module**

🔍 *What it is:*
Node.js includes the built-in events module, which provides the **EventEmitter class**. This class lets you create, emit, and listen for custom events — forming the core of event-driven architecture in Node.

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
Using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in tandem with Event-Driven Programming (EDP) creates a powerful and scalable structure in software design. Here's a breakdown of why and how they complement each other:

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
🗣️ "Imagine you're running a busy coffee shop..."
You're the barista, and you're in charge of taking orders, making coffee, calling out drinks when they're ready, and chatting with customers. You can’t do everything at once, so instead of doing each thing in order (which would make people wait), you respond to things as they happen:
☕ A customer walks in → you take their order.
🧾 The register pings → you know payment went through.
🔔 The espresso machine dings → you call out the drink.
📦 A delivery guy shows up → you quickly check it in.

That’s event-driven behavior. You don’t sit and wait for each thing to finish before moving to the next — you just react when something important happens.

💻 Now, think of the backend server in Node.js like that coffee shop.
Instead of people and coffee, it deals with:
Users clicking buttons (like logging in)

Files being uploaded
Databases returning data
Other computers (like APIs) sending messages

Rather than handling one task at a time, Node.js waits and responds to events when they happen — just like the barista responding to dings and orders. This way, your website or app stays fast, efficient, and doesn’t get bogged dow.
