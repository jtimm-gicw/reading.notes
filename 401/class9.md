# Project Ideas

## Project Name: Super Ruea- Thai Noodle Shop

### Problem Domain
ðŸ§  **Problem Domain**
For our Auth Module Final Project, our team is creating a Thai Noodle Ordering Web App. The goal is to simulate a small restaurantâ€™s online ordering and membership system by applying everything weâ€™ve learned about building a secure backend API with full authentication and access control.

*Users will be able to:*
- Sign up and log in to the site
- Browse a menu of delicious Thai noodle dishes
- Place an order for pickup or delivery
- Earn rewards for being a returning member

Only logged-in users will be able to place orders and earn rewards. Admins will have access to a separate interface where they can **add, update, or delete** menu items (full CRUD), manage orders, and track customer activity. This project gives us a chance to practice building a secure and well-structured CMS (Content Management System) that uses RESTful routes, role-based access control, and user authentication.

Weâ€™ll be using our own API Auth server, and the full backend will be deployed. The frontend will connect to it for all database operations, like retrieving menu items or posting new orders. This lets us reinforce our understanding of protected routes, user permissions, and clean backend design.
