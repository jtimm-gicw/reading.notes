## Questions

### Socket.io Chat Example

1. Explain to a non-technical recruiter what the Chat Example (above) does.
This chat app is a real-time messaging app built with Node.js and Socket.IO — a technology that allows users to chat with each other instantly in the browser.

2. What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app?
- Connection logs
- Disconnection logs
- message logs

3. Socket.IO gives us the i0.emit() method to send an event to everyone. What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket?
If you want to send a message to everyone except the socket that sent it, you use the broadcast flag.

### Rooms

1. What is a room and how might a room be useful?
A **room** is a virtual channel on the server that sockets (connected clients) can join or leave. It's a way to group users together for messaging.
🔒 **Rooms are server-side only** — clients can't see what rooms they’re in.
Rooms are useful when you want to send messages to a specific group of users, instead of everyone.

2. How do you join a room?
Use `socket.join('roomName')` inside your connection handler.
This subscribes the socket to that room so it can receive messages sent to it.

3. How do you leave a room?
Use `socket.leave('roomName')` to unsubscribe a socket from a room.

### Namespaces

1. What is a Namespace and what does it allow you to do?
A **namespace** in Socket.IO is a *separate communication channel or endpoint on the server*, identified by a path like /admin, /chat, etc.
It *allows you to organize your Socket.IO logic into different areas for different features or user roles*.

2. Each namespace potentially has its own what? (hint: 3 things)
        1. event handlers
        2. middleware
        3. Rooms
Each namespace can have its own event handlers, middleware, and rooms, allowing you to organize your app's communication logic cleanly and securely.

3. Discuss a possible use case for separate namespaces.
🧠 **Simple Use Case for Separate Namespaces:**
Imagine you're building a school web app with two types of users:
👩‍🏫 Teachers
👨‍🎓 Students
Both use the same site, but they need different features and access levels.

Using separate namespaces lets you divide your app by role or purpose, so students and teachers each get the features they need without mixing up their data or permissions. It's cleaner, safer, and easier to manage.

### Reflection
1. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
Because I don’t really understand them fully, I am interested in learning more uses of queues.
