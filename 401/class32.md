## Scaling Up with Reducer and Context

1. How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)

When you’re building a React app, sometimes you end up passing state and functions through several layers of components using props. This can get messy and repetitive, especially if many components need access to the same data. That’s where useContext helps—it allows you to share state across the app without having to pass props down manually at every level. It basically creates a “context” or a global container where state can live, and any component that subscribes to that context can use the data directly.

Now, when you combine useReducer with useContext, things get even cleaner. The reducer handles the logic for updating your state in one central place, kind of like a mini version of Redux but built into React. Instead of having multiple useState hooks scattered around, you keep all your state logic in one reducer function. Then, you wrap your app in a context provider and pass the reducer’s state and dispatch function through it. This way, any component can read the state and dispatch actions to update it, without needing to juggle props. Together, they give you a more organized, predictable way to manage state across your app.
