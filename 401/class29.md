### Extracting State Logic into a Reducer

1. What is the motivation for adding a reducer?
A **reducer** is just a function that decides how to update some `state` (data) when something happens.
You give it two things:
        1. The current state (what the data looks like now)
        2. An action (a description of what you want to do, like “add item” or “remove item”)

It returns a new state (the updated data).

*Motivation for adding a reducer*
Normally in React, we use `useState` to keep track of data. But sometimes your state gets more complicated — for example:
- You have multiple pieces of related state.
- You have many ways that the state can change (add, delete, reset, toggle, etc.).
- The logic for updating state starts to get messy.


👉 *That’s when a reducer helps:*
✅ Organizes logic in one place → Instead of spreading state-updating code everywhere, you centralize it in the reducer function.

✅ Makes changes predictable → You always know how state will change because it’s defined by the reducer’s rules.

✅ Easier to test/debug → You can check if an action updates state correctly without running the whole app.

✅ Scales better → When your app grows, managing state through a reducer is cleaner than a bunch of useState calls.

2. What are actions in the context of a reducer? How are they different than setting state directly?
🔹 **What are actions in a reducer?**
An action is just a plain JavaScript object that describes what happened or what you want to do.
Usually it has *two parts*:
- type → tells the reducer what kind of update you want (add, remove, reset, etc.)
- payload → carries the data needed to make that update (like the new todo item text).
The reducer looks at the action and decides how to change state.

🔹 **How is this different from setting state directly?**
👉 With `setState` (useState)
 You usually write logic right where you call setState:
setTodos([...todos, "Buy milk"]);
👉 With `useReducer`
 You don’t update state directly. Instead, you dispatch an action that says what you want to happen, and the reducer decides how state should change.

3. What common list operation is useReduce named for, and why?
The name `useReducer` actually comes from the `Array.prototype.reduce` method in JavaScript.

🔹 **What is reduce** (the array method)?
reduce takes a list (array) and reduces it to a single value by applying a function over and over:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = numbers.**reduce**((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
// sum = 10

*Here:*
`acc` = accumulator (the running result)
`num` = the current item in the list
The **function (acc, num) => acc + num** decides how to combine them

So `reduce` = process list → produce one result.

🔹 **Why is useReducer named after it?**
Because it follows the same idea:
- Instead of reducing an array of numbers into a sum,
- It reduces a sequence of actions into a final state.

4. When should you switch from useState to useReducer?
🔹 **Stick with useState when…**
- *Your state is simple* (a number, a string, a single toggle, or just a couple of values).
- *Updates are straightforward* (e.g., “set count to +1” or “change input text”).
- You *don’t need to organize lots of logic in one place*.
