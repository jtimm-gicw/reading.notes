# Growth Mindset

A **growth mindset** is essential when learning coding because it helps you embrace challenges, learn from mistakes, and stay motivated through tough problems. Coding is full of trial and error—bugs, confusing syntax, and logic errors are all part of the process. With a growth mindset, you see these setbacks not as failures, but as opportunities to improve. Believing that your skills can grow with effort makes it easier to stay curious, keep practicing, and build confidence as a developer. It's not about being perfect—it's about getting better every day.

I do tend to get down on myself when I don't understand something that I feel I should.  I am working on seeing the outcome rather than focusing on the problems now, which may impead my work and learning.
