1. How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?
*“Node is like a kitchen where you can cook JavaScript outside the browser.”*
Usually, JavaScript is used to make websites interactive—like buttons, menus, and pop-ups—and it runs in your browser (like Chrome or Firefox). But Node lets you run JavaScript on your computer, behind the scenes, without a browser.
So instead of making a website button do something, you could use Node to:
- Build a server
- Save data to a file
- Talk to a database
- Or even automate tasks on your computer
Think of it like giving JavaScript a backstage pass so it can do all the heavy lifting that powers apps and websites from behind the curtain.

2. What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?
*It means that Node gives JavaScript a place to run outside the browser.*
Think of JavaScript like a musician. Normally, it only performs in a concert hall (the browser). A runtime is like a new stage where the musician can perform—like a club, a park, or even your living room. 🎸
**So when we say:**
Node is a JavaScript runtime,
**we mean:**
Node gives JavaScript the tools it needs to run on your computer, not just inside a webpage.
It includes things like:
- A way to read files
- A way to talk to the internet
- A way to manage data
All things the browser doesn’t let JavaScript do on its own.

3. What is Node used for?
**Node is used to build the "behind-the-scenes" part of websites and apps.**
You know how when you click something on a website—like “Submit” or “Log in”—and it connects to a server to do something? Node can be that server.

### Additional Questions
1. Looking ahead at this module’s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?
After looking ahead, I am interested in learning more about express and the backend development to gain a better understanding.

2. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
My biggest learning goal is to have a better understanding of how to create a well organized backend using express and exporting modules.
