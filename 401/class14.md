## Event Driven Architecture

## Questions

1. Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.
**"Order Out!"**
*Project Description:*
This project simulates a delivery system for two vendors—Noodies Noodle Shop and Hubba-Boba—using a central event hub with Socket.IO. Vendors send delivery orders to the hub, drivers pick them up, mark them in-transit, and confirm when they’re delivered. The hub manages the message flow and stores events so clients can retrieve missed updates.

### Reflections
