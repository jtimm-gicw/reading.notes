## Questions:
1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.
- HTML: The browser reads the HTML to build the structure of the webpage (DOM).
- CSS: It then reads the CSS to style the elements from the HTML, creating the visual layout (render tree).

*HTML structures the page, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactivity.*

5. What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?
A variable in JavaScript is a named container that stores data. It allows you to label and reference data, such as numbers, strings, or objects, so you can use or manipulate that data later in your code. 
- You can think of a variable like a storage box: you give the box a label (the variable's name) and place something inside (the value). When you need that value, you refer to the box by its label.

6. What is an HTML attribute?

7. Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element. 
An HTML element is made up of an opening tag (with optional attributes), content, and a closing tag. This structure defines how the element appears and functions on a webpage.
What is the Difference between `<article>` and `<section>` element tags?
`<article>` is for self-contained content that could stand alone, while `<section>` is for thematically related content that contributes to a broader topic.
Use `<section>` to organize content into thematic areas.
Inside each `<section>`, use `<article>` to represent individual pieces of content related to that theme.
This structure enhances clarity, accessibility, and search engine optimization.

8. What Elements does a “typical” website include?
A typical website includes a header, navigation menu, main content area, sidebar, footer, articles, multimedia, forms, call-to-action buttons, and social media links, all working together to create an organized and user-friendly experience.

10. How is the `<meta>` HTML tag used when specifying metadata?
