### **HTML**

1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?
Using semantic HTML leads to better accessibility, SEO, code readability, and future-proofing, while promoting good development practices.
2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML?
6 levels (h1-h6)
3. What are some uses for the `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements?
These elements provide visual clarity for complex notations in text, such as mathematical equations, scientific formulas, or references.
4. When using the `<abbr>` element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?
When using the `<abbr>` element in HTML, the title attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the abbreviation or acronym. This allows the browser to display the full meaning when the user hovers over the abbreviation, enhancing accessibility and clarity.

### **CSS**

1. What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?
Inline, internal, and external
2. Why should we avoid using inline styles?
Maintainability
Readability
Not best practice
Creates large files
Performance 
Slower parsing
3. Review the block of code below and answer the following questions: What is representing the selector? 
h2
4. Which components are the CSS declarations? The lines within the curly brackets.
5. Which components are considered properties? 
Color and padding.

### **JS**

1. What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks? 
strings
2. List 4 types of JavaScript operators. 
Arithmetic, logical operators, assignment operators, & comparison.
3. Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function. 
You have a list of items with different prices in a shopping cart, and you want to calculate the total cost automatically, instead of manually adding up each price. You can write a JavaScript function that takes a list of item prices as input, adds them together, and returns the total cost.
4. An if statement checks a *condition* and if it evaluates to *true*, then the code block will execute.
5. What is the use of an *else if*? 
It helps you handle multiple conditions sequentially. If the first condition is false, it moves on to the next else if condition, and so on. Once a condition evaluates to true, the corresponding block of code runs, and the rest of the conditions are skipped.
6. List 3 different types of comparison operators.
equal to ==, greater than or equal to >=, & not equal to !==
7. What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||? 
&& (AND) requires all conditions to be true for the entire expression to be true.  || (OR) requires only one condition to be true for the entire expression to be true.
Both operators are used to combine conditions, but the results depend on whether you need all conditions to be true (&&) or just one (||).

## Things I want to know more about:
*Javascript. I think some step by step, easy conditionals and functions would help make things more clear.*
