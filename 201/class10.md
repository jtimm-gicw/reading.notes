1. **Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error. Here are the key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error:**
**Syntax Error**
- Definition: Occurs when the code violates the rules of the programming language's syntax.
- Detection: Detected during code compilation or interpretation. The program won't run until the syntax issue is fixed.
**Logic Error**
- Definition: Occurs when the code is syntactically correct but produces incorrect or unintended behavior.
- Detection: Not detected during compilation; only identified through testing or runtime behavior.

2. **List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**
**Syntax Errors**
*Example:* Forgetting to close a bracket or misspelling a variable name.
Encountered in: A JavaScript guessing game project.
- Resolution: I used the browser console and my IDE's error highlighting to locate the problem. Carefully reviewing the code line by line helped me find missing brackets or syntax issues. Using a linter like ESLint also helped prevent similar mistakes in the future.
**Logical Errors**
*Example:* Setting the wrong condition in an if statement, causing the program to behave unpredictably.
*Encountered in:* A function where I was comparing a user’s guess against the target number but used the assignment operator (=) instead of the equality operator (===).
*Resolution:* I added console.log() statements to debug and trace the variable values. This helped me identify the incorrect operator and fix the condition.
**Runtime Errors**
*Example:* Calling a function before it was defined or attempting to access a property of undefined.
Encountered in: While dynamically updating the DOM in a front-end project.
*Resolution:* I debugged the error using the browser's developer tools and verified the order of operations in my code. Ensuring that variables and DOM elements were defined before accessing them resolved the issue.
**Off-by-One Errors**
*Example:* Looping through an array but missing the last element due to using < instead of <= in the loop condition.
*Encountered in:* Iterating through arrays to display data on a webpage.
*Resolution:* I identified the issue by carefully stepping through the loop with debugging tools and modified the loop condition to include all elements.
**Type Errors**
*Example:* Attempting to perform arithmetic on a string or calling a method that doesn’t exist on a variable type.
*Encountered in:* A form validation script where user inputs were strings instead of numbers.
*Resolution:* I used parseInt() or parseFloat() to convert the string to a number and added validation checks to ensure the data type was correct before processing it.

3. **How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?** The ability to identify and resolve programming errors will be an ongoing influence, helping me grow as a developer, collaborate effectively, and achieve my long-term goal of making meaningful contributions to the tech industry.

4. **How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**  The JavaScript Debugger tool is a built-in feature in most modern web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) that helps developers identify and fix issues in their JavaScript code. Think of it as a magnifying glass for your code that lets you pause and carefully inspect how it’s working step by step. 
**Here's a beginner-friendly explanation:**
*What the JavaScript Debugger Does*
- Finds Bugs: It helps you locate errors or unexpected behavior in your code.
- Pauses Code Execution: You can stop the code at specific points to see exactly what’s happening.
- Shows Variable Values: It allows you to check the values of variables at different stages in your program.
- Step-by-Step Execution: You can run your code one line at a time to better understand the flow and catch mistakes.
In short, the JavaScript Debugger is like your programming assistant, helping you see and understand exactly what's happening in your code. It’s one of the best tools to learn how to write better and bug-free code!

5. **Define what a breakpoint is.**  A breakpoint is a tool used in debugging to pause the execution of your code at a specific line. It allows you to inspect what is happening in your program at that exact point. By setting breakpoints, you can examine the state of variables, see the flow of execution, and identify issues in your code.

6. **How to Use a Breakpoint:**
a. Open your browser's Developer Tools.
b. Navigate to the Sources (or equivalent) tab.
c. Find the JavaScript file or script you want to debug.
d. Click on the line number where you want to pause execution; this sets the breakpoint.
e. Run your program, and the browser will pause execution when it reaches that line.

7. **What is the call stack?**  The call stack is a data structure used by JavaScript to keep track of function calls and their order during the execution of a program. It works like a stack of plates, following the Last In, **First Out *(LIFO)* principle—meaning the last function added (or called) is the first one to complete**.
