1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
it means that Flexbox manages layout and alignment along a single axis at a time—either horizontally (row) or vertically (column).
**In practical terms:**
One-dimensional layout refers to arranging items in a single row or a single column, but not both at the same time.
Flexbox does not handle grid-like (two-dimensional) layouts where both rows and columns need to be explicitly defined and managed.
*How Flexbox Works with One-Dimensional Content:*
Main Axis:
- The primary direction in which items are laid out.
Controlled by the flex-direction property, which can be:
- row (horizontal layout from left to right)
- row-reverse (horizontal layout from right to left)
- column (vertical layout from top to bottom)
- column-reverse (vertical layout from bottom to top)
Cross Axis:
- The direction perpendicular to the main axis.
- Alignment along this axis is controlled using align-items or align-self.
- The main axis is horizontal (row), so the buttons are distributed across the row (justify-content).
- The cross axis is vertical, so the buttons align vertically in the center (align-items).
If you need layouts that require alignment in both horizontal and vertical directions simultaneously, like a grid of cards, CSS Grid is more suitable. Flexbox, however, excels in scenarios where content flows naturally in one direction and needs dynamic spacing and alignment.

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
Imagine you’re arranging a row of picture frames on a shelf. The way you organize the frames depends on the shelf’s direction:
*Main Axis:*
- This is the direction in which you line up the picture frames.
- If the shelf is horizontal, you’re arranging the frames side by side. That’s the main axis.
- If the shelf were vertical, you’d stack the frames on top of each other. That would be the main axis in a vertical direction.
*Cross Axis:*
- This is the direction perpendicular to the main axis.
- For a horizontal shelf, the cross axis would be up and down (how tall the frames are or how you align them vertically).
- For a vertical shelf, the cross axis would be left and right (how centered or aligned the frames are horizontally).

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
Using Flexbox improperly or without considering accessibility principles can lead to challenges for users who rely on assistive technologies or have certain disabilities. Here are some ways Flexbox properties can negatively impact accessibility and how to avoid them:
*Changing the Visual Order with order*
- **Problem:** The order property can rearrange items visually, but the DOM (document structure) order remains unchanged. This can confuse users who rely on screen readers, as the screen reader follows the DOM order, not the visual layout.
- **Solution:** Ensure the DOM order matches the logical reading order whenever possible. Use order sparingly and thoughtfully.
*Alignment and Spacing Issues with justify-content and align-items*

*Flex-Growing or Shrinking (flex-grow and flex-shrink)*

*Focus Order and Tab Navigation*

*Insufficient Contrast and Spacing*

- Keep the DOM order logical for screen readers.
- Test the layout with keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- Avoid excessive dynamic resizing or misaligned tab order.
- Always verify usability with accessibility tools and user testing.
