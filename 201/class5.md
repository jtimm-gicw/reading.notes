## HTML
1. **What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website**?** When a disabled person moves their mouse over an image, the alt attribute will allow the browser to read the description aloud to them.

2. **How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?**
- Use descriptive alt text for meaningful images.
- Leave alt text empty for decorative images to let screen readers skip them.
- Add captions with `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for more context.
- Describe complex images with surrounding text or ARIA attributes.
- Use high-contrast colors and avoid embedding essential text within images.
- Ensure responsive design using srcset and sizes for readability across devices.
- Consider the context and purpose of each image for better user understanding.

3. **Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.**
The `<figure>` element is useful for grouping images, illustrations, diagrams, code snippets, or other content that is referenced in the main text but could stand alone.

Image with a Caption:
- When displaying an image that requires additional context, the `<figcaption>` element inside `<figure>` provides a clear, accessible caption.
Diagrams or Illustrations:
- For complex diagrams or illustrations that are explained in detail, `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` help separate this content from the main text.
- `<figure>` can wrap tables or charts that need additional explanations, like data sources or insights, for better readability.
Code Snippets with Descriptions:
- For a block of code within an article or tutorial, `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` make it easy to label and describe the code snippet's purpose.
- In an article, `<figure>` can be used to contain a sidebar image or quote with context, adding value to the main text but functioning independently.
Maps with Location Information:
- When including a map (e.g., for a store location), `<figure>` allows for a caption that provides additional address information or navigation details.
Historical or Artistic Images:
- For images in articles about history, art, or culture, `<figure>` allows the caption to detail the image’s origin, artist, or historical context.
- Using `<figure>` in these contexts improves semantic structure, accessibility, and enhances user experience by clearly associating content with its description.

4. Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.  
GIF (Graphics Interchange Format):
- A GIF is like a short, animated picture that can move, sort of like a little video with no sound. For example, a GIF might show a flower blooming or a cat waving its paw.
- GIFs are made up of small, colored squares (called pixels) arranged to create a picture, so they can get blurry if they’re stretched too big.
- GIFs are often used for fun animations or to show movement in a simple way.

4. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics):
- An SVG is a type of image that stays sharp and clear no matter how big or small you make it. It’s more like a blueprint than a regular picture, because it’s based on lines and shapes, not pixels.
- SVGs don’t work well for animations or moving pictures, but they’re perfect for things like logos, icons, or simple designs, where clarity is important.
- Because they can be resized without losing quality, SVGs are great for images that need to look crisp on both small screens (like a phone) and big screens (like a computer).
*In short, GIFs are for simple, moving images that can get blurry if made too big, while SVGs are for sharp, clear images that stay smooth at any size but usually don’t move.*

5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
For displaying a screenshot on a website, the best choice is typically a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image. 
- High Quality and Clarity:
PNG images keep fine details and text sharp, which is essential for screenshots that often include text and interface elements.
- Supports Transparency: 
PNGs can have transparent backgrounds, so if your screenshot includes parts of an interface that blend with your website’s background, it will look clean and professional.
- Lossless Compression: 
PNGs use a lossless compression method, meaning they don’t lose detail when saved, which is important for preserving the accuracy of a screenshot.
*JPEGs are another option, but they use lossy compression, which can make text and fine details look blurry or distorted. For screenshots, PNG is the go-to choice to ensure clarity and accuracy.*


## CSS
1.  Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge. Think of an HTML element as a piece of paper with text on it:
Foreground Color: 
- This is like the color of the text or anything written on the paper. If the text is black, then black is the foreground color. It’s the part you focus on because it’s the information you’re trying to read.
- Background Color: 
This is the color of the paper itself. If the paper is white, then white is the background color. The background color sits behind the text, making it easier to see or read. If you change the background to a dark color, you might also want to change the text (foreground) to a light color so it stands out clearly.
*The foreground color is for the main content, like text, and the background color is what sits behind it, making the content stand out.*
2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character? 
Pick a Color Scheme:
- Start with a main color that reflects the blog’s vibe—like blue for a calm, trustworthy feel, green for a natural vibe, or yellow for a cheerful, energetic look.
- Choose a secondary color or two to complement the main color and add variety, but keep it simple to avoid overwhelming readers.
- Use a neutral color (like gray, white, or beige) for the background, so the blog stays easy to read.
Add Color to the Header and Footer:
- Make the header and footer stand out with the main color or a darker shade of it. This frames the blog nicely and makes it feel more polished.
- Add a bit of the secondary color to the navigation menu or footer links for interest.
Use Background Colors to Highlight Sections:
- Give each section (like the blog posts, sidebar, and footer) a slightly different background color or shade. This breaks up the content and makes the page easier to navigate.
*For example, blog post backgrounds can be a light shade of the main color, while the sidebar uses a softer color from the scheme.*
Enhance Text and Links with Foreground Colors:
- Make headings or titles a bolder version of the main color to grab attention without adding too much color.
- Use the secondary color for links and buttons, which makes them easy to spot and interact with.
Add a Touch of Color to Borders and Dividers:
- Light borders or lines in a neutral shade can help structure content without heavy contrast.
- Adding a hint of the main color to these borders can subtly reinforce the color scheme.
Include a Background or Accent Color for Call-to-Action Areas:
- If there are any call-to-action buttons (like “Subscribe” or “Read More”), make them stand out with a bold color from the palette to catch the eye.
3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
When choosing fonts for an HTML document, there are several key factors to consider for readability, aesthetics, and compatibility:
Readability:
- Choose fonts that are easy to read, especially for long-form content. Sans-serif fonts (like Arial or Helvetica) are generally easier to read on screens, while serif fonts (like Times New Roman or Georgia) can work well for headings or shorter text blocks.
Font Pairing:
- Select two or three fonts that complement each other. For example, you might use a serif font for headings and a sans-serif for body text to create contrast and interest without overwhelming the design.
- Avoid too many different fonts, as this can make the document look cluttered and unprofessional.
Web-Safe Fonts vs. Web Fonts:
- Web-safe fonts (like Arial, Verdana, and Times New Roman) are standard on most devices, ensuring consistent appearance across platforms.
- If you want unique fonts, consider using web fonts from Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts, but make sure they load efficiently to avoid slowing down the page.
Font Size and Scaling:
- Use a base font size that’s comfortable for reading, typically around 16px for body text.
- Choose fonts that scale well across devices. A responsive design adjusts font sizes for different screen sizes to maintain readability on both mobile and desktop.
Accessibility:
- Ensure good contrast between text and background colors. This is crucial for readability, especially for users with visual impairments.
- Avoid overly stylized or decorative fonts for main content, as they can be hard to read, especially for users with cognitive disabilities.
Load Time and Performance:
- Web fonts add to page load time, so limit the number of custom fonts used. Prioritize fonts that support various weights (bold, italic) without requiring separate files for each weight.
Consistency with Brand or Theme:
- Choose fonts that align with the tone and purpose of the content. For instance, a formal blog may use traditional serif fonts, while a tech or creative blog might use modern sans-serif or quirky display fonts.
4. What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?
- *font-size:* Sets the size of the text, affecting how big or small it appears.
- *font-weight:* Controls the thickness of the text, like making it bold (bold or 700) or light (light or 300).
- *font-style:* Changes the style of the text, such as making it italic (italic) or keeping it normal (normal).
5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.
letter-spacing:
- This property controls the space between each character in the h1 text, spreading them apart or bringing them closer together.
padding:
- Padding adds space inside the h1 element around the text itself, pushing it away from the edges of the element box. This doesn’t space out individual characters, but it adds room around the text within the h1 element.
