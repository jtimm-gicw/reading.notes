1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
*Evolution of Media Delivery on the Web*

**Early 2000s:** Media relied on plugins like Flash, RealPlayer, and QuickTime, which were non-standard, buggy, and insecure.
**2004:** Development of HTML5 began to improve native media integration without plugins.
**2007–2010:** HTML5 introduced `<video>` and `<audio>` elements, leading to the decline of Flash as browsers adopted native media playback.
**2010s:** Adaptive streaming (HLS, DASH) enabled smooth playback under varying network conditions. WebRTC facilitated live, plugin-free streaming between users.
**2015 onwards:** HTML5 became the standard, Flash was deprecated (discontinued in 2020), and modern codecs like H.264, VP9, and AV1 improved media quality and efficiency.
**2020s:** Advanced web APIs (e.g., MediaStream, Web Audio API) enabled features like video conferencing and augmented reality, supported by tools like WebAssembly for real-time processing. Streaming platforms became more accessible.

2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.  src attribute: Specifies the file path or URL of the video you want to play. It tells the browser where to find the video.
- *`src` Attribute:*
The src attribute in the `<video>` element specifies the file path or URL of the video file to be played. It tells the browser where to locate the video resource. For example:
`<video src="example.mp4"></video>`
- *controls attribute:* Adds playback controls (play, pause, volume, etc.) to the video player so users can interact with it.
Example: `<video src="example.mp4" controls></video>`

3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the `<video>` element?  Fallback content inside the `<video>` element is important because:
- **Browser compatibility:** Some older browsers or less common browsers may not support the <video> element or the specific video format.
- **Graceful degradation:** If the video can't be displayed, fallback content like a message or a link to download the video provides users with an alternative.
- **Accessibility:** Ensures that all users, regardless of their device or browser capabilities, can still access the content in some form.

4.  Write a very short story where `<audio>` and `<video>` are characters. 
Once upon a time in Webland, two siblings, Audio and Video, lived in the bustling HTML5 village.
Audio was the storyteller—always sharing music, podcasts, and soothing sounds. "I bring life to silence!" she’d say, proudly filling the air with melodies and voices.
Video, her animated brother, was the entertainer. "I combine sound and sight to tell stories!" he’d exclaim, playing movies and live streams on glowing screens.
One day, a visitor named User arrived. "I need to share my travel adventures!" he said.
Audio hummed a travel song, and Video played vivid clips of mountains and rivers. Together, they created an unforgettable experience.
From then on, User made sure to always keep both siblings on his webpages, knowing they worked best as a team.

## Grid

1. How does Grid layout differ from Flex?
Grid and Flexbox are both CSS layout systems, but they are used for different purposes:
- **Flexbox**
Works one dimension at a time: you can lay out items in a row (horizontally) or a column (vertically).
Best for aligning items in a single direction or for small, dynamic layouts like navigation bars.
Example: Lining up buttons in a row or stacking them in a column.
- **Grid**
Works in two dimensions: you can control rows and columns simultaneously.
Best for complex layouts that require precise placement of items in a grid-like structure.
*Example:* Creating a webpage with sections for a header, sidebar, main content, and footer.

2. Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.
**Grid Container:** The box or area where the grid is created. It’s the parent element that holds all the items and defines the grid layout (like a frame for organizing everything).
**Grid Item:** The individual pieces or elements placed inside the grid container. These can be anything like images, text, or buttons. Each item lives in its own grid cell or area.
**Grid Line:** The invisible lines that divide the grid into rows and columns. Think of them as the lines on graph paper that help organize where things go.

## Responsive Images
1. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?
Making images responsive is important not just for visual appeal but for several practical reasons:
- *Improved Performance:* Responsive images adapt to the user's screen size and resolution, ensuring smaller file sizes are delivered when possible. This reduces loading times and improves site speed.
- *Better User Experience:* Users on mobile devices or slower networks benefit from images that load quickly and display properly without requiring extra scrolling or zooming.
- *Bandwidth Savings:* Serving appropriately sized images helps users save data, which is especially important for those on limited data plans.
- *SEO Benefits:* Faster load times and a mobile-friendly site improve search engine rankings, as search engines prioritize well-optimized websites.
- *Accessibility:* Responsive images ensure everyone, regardless of device or internet speed, can access and enjoy the content.
- *Future-Proofing:* With a wide range of devices and screen sizes in use (and more coming), responsive images help ensure the site works well everywhere.

2. Define the following `<img>` attributes `srcset` and `sizes`. Write an example of how they are used.
**srcset Attribute**
Defines a list of different image files for the browser to choose from.
Helps the browser pick the best image based on screen size or resolution.
**sizes Attribute**
Tells the browser how much space the image will take up on the screen (relative to the viewport).
Works with srcset to decide which image file to download.

3. How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?
Using srcset for responsive images is more helpful than CSS or JavaScript because:
- **Efficiency:**
The browser chooses the best image file to load before downloading anything, saving time and bandwidth.
CSS or JavaScript might only adjust the image after it’s already been loaded, which can waste resources.
- **Simpler to Use:**
`srcset` is built directly into HTML, making it easier to set up responsive images without writing extra code or complex logic.
- **Better Performance:**
Browsers automatically handle the decision-making based on screen size, resolution, and device capabilities, ensuring optimal performance.
With CSS or JavaScript, developers need to manually write logic, which can slow down the page or introduce errors.
- **Fallback Ready:**
If a browser doesn’t support srcset, it falls back to the `src` attribute automatically, ensuring compatibility.
*In short, srcset is faster, simpler, and more reliable for responsive images than relying on CSS or JavaScript.*
