**How can I change my car's oil.  Give me steps based on the fact I have no experience with cars and I know basics about how cars work.  Iam a novice when it comes to cars.**

Materials You’ll Need:
- New oil (check your car's manual for the right type and quantity)
- New oil filter (specific to your car model)
- Oil filter wrench
- Oil drain pan
- Socket wrench set
- Funnel
- Car jack and jack stands (or ramps)
- Gloves and rags
- Oil filter gasket (if required)
- Owner's manual
Step-by-Step Process:
1. Prepare Your Car:
Park on a level surface: Ensure your car is on flat ground, and engage the parking brake.
Warm up the engine: Start your car and let it run for 5 minutes. Warm oil flows better, making it easier to drain.
Turn off the engine and wait a few minutes for it to cool down slightly (so you don’t get burned by hot oil).
2. Lift Your Car (if needed):
Jack up your car using a jack and place jack stands under the car for support. Alternatively, you can drive the car onto ramps.
Check the owner’s manual to locate the recommended jack points under your car.
3. Locate the Oil Drain Plug and Oil Filter:
Find the oil drain plug: This is a bolt on the bottom of your car's oil pan, usually under the engine.
Locate the oil filter: Typically a small cylinder (the size varies by car), often located near the drain plug.
4. Drain the Old Oil:
Position the oil drain pan: Place the drain pan under the oil drain plug.
Remove the drain plug: Use a socket wrench to unscrew the plug counterclockwise. Be ready for the oil to flow out quickly.
Let the oil drain completely: This can take a few minutes (5-10 minutes). Wipe the drain plug clean with a rag once oil has stopped dripping.
5. Remove and Replace the Oil Filter:
Use the oil filter wrench: Loosen the old oil filter by turning it counterclockwise. Be careful, as some oil may still be in the filter.
Prepare the new filter: Before installing the new filter, rub a small amount of new oil around the gasket (rubber seal) of the new filter. This ensures a better seal.
Install the new filter: Screw the new filter on by hand until it’s snug. Don’t overtighten it—hand-tight is usually enough.
6. Reinstall the Drain Plug:
Clean the area around the drain plug: Wipe away any oil residue.
Reinstall the drain plug: Screw the drain plug back in by hand and then tighten it securely with a socket wrench (but don’t over-tighten).
7. Add the New Oil:
Locate the oil fill cap: It’s usually labeled “Engine Oil” on top of the engine.
Use a funnel: Place a funnel in the oil fill hole and slowly pour in the new oil.
Check the oil level: After adding the recommended amount of oil (as per your car's manual), pull out the dipstick (located near the engine) to check the oil level. It should be within the “Full” range.
8. Check for Leaks:
Run the engine for a few minutes: Start the car and let it run for a couple of minutes, then turn it off.
Inspect underneath: Check under the car for any oil leaks around the drain plug or oil filter.
9. Lower the Car and Dispose of Old Oil:
Lower the car from the jack stands or ramps.
Dispose of the old oil: Transfer the old oil to a sealed container (like the one the new oil came in), and take it to a recycling center or auto parts store for proper disposal.
10. Final Check:
After lowering the car and driving it for a few minutes, check the oil level again using the dipstick to ensure it’s correct.
Clean up any spilled oil and dispose of the old oil filter properly.
