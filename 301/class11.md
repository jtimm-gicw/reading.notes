## Questions

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
**SQL**

 - Uses structured data with predefined schemas (tables with rows and columns).
 - Uses flexible data models (document, key-value, graph, or wide-column).
 - Requires a fixed schema; changes often require migrations.
 - Schema-less or dynamic schema, allowing for easier updates and flexibility.

**NoSQL**

 - Scales vertically (upgrading the server's hardware).
 - Scales horizontally (adding more servers/nodes).
 - Uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying.
 - Uses various query methods depending on the database type (e.g., JSON-based queries for MongoDB).
- Best for complex queries, structured data, and ACID compliance (e.g., banking, ERP systems).
- Ideal for big data, real-time web apps, and unstructured data (e.g., social media, IoT).

2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
SQL databases are best suited for structured data—data that fits neatly into tables with rows and columns and follows a consistent format. 

3. Give a real world example.
*Real-World Example*: A Bank's Customer and Account Management System
Scenario:
A bank needs to manage data about its customers, their bank accounts, transactions, and loan records. This data must be accurate, consistent, and highly structured.

4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
NoSQL databases are perfect when you need flexibility, speed, and the ability to scale easily—especially with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.

5. Give a real world example.
*Real-World Example*: Social Media App (e.g., Instagram, TikTok)
Scenario:
You're building a social media app where users can post photos or videos, like and comment on posts, follow other users, and send messages. Each user’s data is different and can grow fast.

6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
For hierarchical data storage, the best type of database often depends on how deeply nested or interconnected the hierarchy is.

7. Which type of database is best for scalability?
When it comes to scalability, especially as your data and user base grow

1. What does SQL stand for?
Structured Query Language
It’s a special language used to talk to databases. 

2. What is a relational database?
A relational database is a type of database that stores data in tables—like a spreadsheet with rows and columns—and shows how that data is related to other data.

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
A relational database works with a table-based structure — kind of like Excel sheets, but with powerful connections between them.

4. What is a ‘schema’?
A schema is like a blueprint or plan that defines the structure of your data.
🧠 Think of it like a form template — it tells the database what kind of data to expect, and how it should be organized.

5. What is a NoSQL database?
NoSQL stands for “Not Only SQL” — it refers to databases that don’t use traditional relational tables like SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Instead of using rows and columns, NoSQL databases use flexible data structures — like documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-columns.

6. How does it work?
🧠 Core Idea:
NoSQL databases don’t use tables with rows and columns like traditional SQL databases.
Instead, they store data in more flexible, dynamic formats, depending on the type of NoSQL database you're using.
