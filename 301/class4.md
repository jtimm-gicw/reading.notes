### How to use form in react
1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
A Controlled Component in React is a form element (like an input, textarea, or select) where React controls the value instead of the browser. This means the component’s value is stored in the state, and any change to it is handled by React.
*Why Use Controlled Components?*
**Single Source of Truth** – The state holds the value, so it’s predictable.
**Easier Validation – You can validate input before updating the state.
**Better Control** – You can modify, reset, or manipulate input values easily.
*In contrast, an Uncontrolled Component lets the browser handle the value, using ref instead of state.*

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why?
It’s generally better to update the state as soon as the user enters their response, rather than waiting until they submit the form. Here’s why:

**Advantages of Updating State Immediately (Controlled Components)**
*Real-Time Validation* – You can check and give feedback (e.g., error messages) while the user types.
*Instant UI Updates* – You can dynamically enable/disable buttons or modify UI elements based on input.
*Better User Experience* – Users see their input reflected instantly, avoiding confusion.
*Easier Data Handling* – Since React state always has the latest values, you don’t need to extract values from the form at submission.

**When to Store Data Only on Submit?**
In some cases, like when handling large forms or when performance is a concern (e.g., avoiding too many re-renders), you might prefer to collect data only when the form is submitted. This approach is common in uncontrolled components where you use useRef() instead of state.

**Which One to Choose?**
*For most cases* → Update state as the user types (Controlled Components).
*For very large or performance-sensitive forms* → Consider storing data only on submit (Uncontrolled Components with refs).

In some cases, like when handling large forms or when performance is a concern (e.g., avoiding too many re-renders), you might prefer to collect data only when the form is submitted. This approach is common in uncontrolled components where you use `useRef()` instead of `state`.
**Which One to Choose?**
*For most cases* → Update state as the user types (Controlled Components).
*For very large or performance-sensitive forms* → Consider storing data only on submit (Uncontrolled Components with refs).

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
To target what the user is entering in an input field, we use the event object (event or e) inside the event handler. The value of the input can be accessed using *e.target.value*.

**How it works**
- The `onChange event` triggers handleChange every time the user types.
- `e.target.value` gets the latest text from the input field.
- `setInputValue`(e.target.value) updates the state with the new value.

### The Conditional (Ternary) Operator explained
1. Why would we use a ternary operator?
A ternary operator is a shortcut for writing an if...else statement in JavaScript. It helps make code shorter and more readable when you need to decide between two values.

**Basic Syntax:**
	condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;
 If the condition is true, it returns `valueIfTrue`, otherwise, it returns `valueIfFalse`.

**Common Use Cases**
- Setting a Value Based on a Condition
let theme = isDarkMode ? "Dark Theme" : "Light Theme";
- Rendering UI in React
{isLoggedIn ? <Dashboard /> : <Login />}
- Showing a Default Value
let username = userInput ? userInput : "Guest";
// Same as: let username = userInput || "Guest";
  
2.  Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

let same = x===y ? true : false;
