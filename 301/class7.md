## Questions


1. **To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?**
I think because of my experience and position in the organization, I felt relatively safe when deciding something.  If an idea was shot down then I would go 'back to the drawing board' and try again.
2. **How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?**
It just reemphasized that 'everyone is different' more apparent in our team dynamics and that you should be an individual but be will to build relationships.
*How I explained REST to my brother*
1. **Who is Roy Fielding?**
Roy Fielding is a computer scientist who helped develop HTTP and wrote the specifications that define how the web works. He also introduced the REST architectural style, which structures how web resources are accessed and manipulated.
2. **Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**
Traditional techniques for machine communication were not designed for global scalability. They were built for small, controlled environments and lacked universal ways to reference and exchange data. REST, built on HTTP, was designed from the start to support global communication between machines.

3. **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a communication protocol that enables web browsers and servers to exchange information. It allows web pages, images, and other resources to be requested and retrieved using URLs.

4. **What does a GET do?**
A GET request retrieves data from a specified resource (e.g., loading a web page, fetching an image, or getting user data from an API).

5. **What does a POST do?**
A POST request submits new data to a server, creating a new resource (e.g., submitting a form, adding a new user in a database)

6. **What does PUT do?**
A PUT request updates or replaces an existing resource with new data (e.g., updating a user’s profile with new information).

**What does PATCH do?**
A PATCH request applies a partial update to an existing resource, modifying only specific fields rather than replacing the entire resource.
API Keys

*Request a personal API key from the following APIs. You should receive these in your email within a few hours, often within minutes. Please request these keys prior to lecture to allow adequate time because you will need them in order to complete your lab assignment. Note: do not post your API keys in the Canvas discussion or on GitHub. Save them in a secure place.*
