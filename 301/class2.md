## Questions

1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‚Äòrender‚Äô or the ‚Äò**componentDidMount**‚Äô?
*componentDidMount*, This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted.
2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
Mounting
3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates
**Final Order of Execution:**
1Ô∏è‚É£ constructor() ‚Üí (if present)
2Ô∏è‚É£ render() ‚Üí (UI is generated)
3Ô∏è‚É£ componentDidMount() ‚Üí (Runs after mounting, e.g., fetching data)
4Ô∏è‚É£ React Updates ‚Üí (Component re-renders if state/props change)
5Ô∏è‚É£ componentWillUnmount() ‚Üí (Cleanup before the component is removed)
4. What does componentDidMount do?
**componentDidMount()** is a lifecycle method in React that runs after a component has been added to the DOM (mounted).

üëâ It is mainly used for:
‚úÖ Fetching data from an API
‚úÖ Setting up event listeners
‚úÖ Subscribing to services
‚úÖ Updating the state after the initial render
### Notes
React lets you define components as *classes or functions*. The **methods** that you are able to use on these are called **lifecycle events**.
Methods can be **called** during the **lifecycle of a component**, and they allow you to update the UI and application states.

1. What types of things can you pass in the props?
In React, you can pass various types of data as props to components. 
- strings
- booleans
- numbers 
- null
- objects
- arrays
- function (callback functions)
- JSX components 
- React elements

2. What is the big difference between props and state?
The big difference between props and state in React is:
**Props are immutable (read-only) and passed from *parent to child* components.** They allow data to flow down the component tree but cannot be changed by the receiving component.
**State is mutable (changeable) and managed *within* a component.** It allows a component to track and update data dynamically.

3. When do we re-render our application?
**State Changes ‚Üí** If you update a component's state using useState or this.setState, React re-renders that component.
**Props Change ‚Üí** If a parent component passes new props to a child component, the child re-renders.

4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
1Ô∏è‚É£ User Input (Forms)
- Storing values typed by a user in an input field.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Counters & Numbers
- Storing and updating a counter value.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Boolean Flags (UI State)
- Tracking things like modals, dropdowns, or dark mode.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Lists & Arrays
- Keeping track of multiple items (e.g., a to-do list).
5Ô∏è‚É£ Objects (User Data, API Responses)
- Storing data like user profiles.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Fetched Data (from APIs)
- Storing API responses dynamically.
7Ô∏è‚É£ Theme (Dark Mode, Language)
- Switching between light and dark mode.
